// color variable practice

// this sketch creates a single color variable, loads a color into it
// with the color() function, and then uses it to draw the background.

// change the color variable to an array of color variables. add as many
// as you like. then in the draw loop, set the background to some color
// in the array. this might look like: 

// background(c[whichColor]);

// use either conditional logic or a modulo operator to have which color 
// is being used by background() change periodically. see the example gif.

color c = 255;
color d = 160;
color e = 50;



void setup() {
  c = color(255, 0, 0);
}

void draw() {
  background(c);
}
